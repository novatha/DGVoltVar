	The cornerstone of this technique is constructing one single building
	block matrix, called the radial configuration matrix (RCM), which
	is utilized in carrying out the radial power flow backward/forward
	iterative steps. The RCM is designed to have a small condition number
	with a determinant and all of its eigenvalues be equal to one to
	ensure its invertibility. By incorporating this matrix and its direct
	descendant matrices in solving the power flow problem, the CPU execution
	time is decreased compared with other methods. The FFRPF method is
	flexible in accommodating any changes that may take place in an existing
	radial distribution system since these changes can be exclusively
	incorporated within this matrix. The FFRPF is tested by using several
	balanced and unbalanced three-phase radial distribution systems.},

	on line current flows in rectangular coordinates for radial distribution
	systems. The functions of line current flows and their equivalent
	values, which are computed from the specified load powers, are linearised
	around a known operating point and transformed through a constant
	matrix with a view to eliminate the off-diagonal blocks of the Jacobian.
	The transformation enables perfect decoupling of the power flow problem
	into two sub-problems without making any assumptions on voltage magnitudes,
	angles and r/x ratios. The approach is simple and uses a sparse constant
	sub-Jacobian matrix that needs to be factorised only once for both
	real and reactive sub-problems; and is solved iteratively similar
	to FDPF technique. Test results of 15, 29 and 69 node systems indicate
	that the proposed method is efficient, robust, accurate and exhibits
	potential for on-line applications.},

	in two different cases: case a) AC grids with embedded VSC-based
	MTDC grids, and case b) asynchronous AC grids connected via a common
	VSC-based MTDC grid. In the proposed method for each MTDC grid (regardless
	of the number of converters), a new state variable is introduced
	to handle any kind of converter loss models. For the case (b), the
	AC-DC unit can be used in two different analyses, namely, a1) the
	separated analysis and a2) the integrated analysis. Both a1) and
	a2) can be used in the practical analysis of the real-size power
	systems. However, it is shown that the separated analysis not only
	offers a shorter computational time but it is also very suitable
	for the future connection between large existing AC systems and other
	AC systems or remote renewable energy sources through the DC grids.
	The proposed methodology is implemented in MATLAB software and verified
	using commercial software SIMPOW.},

	chosen environment for the development of the optimization software.
	A class of hybrid algorithms, of which branch-and-bound and polyhedral
	outer approximation are the two extreme cases, are proposed and implemented.

  abstract = {The widespread use of distributed generation (DG), which is installed
	in medium-voltage distribution networks, impacts the future development
	of modern electrical systems that must evolve towards smart grids.
	A fundamental topic for smart grids is automatic distributed voltage
	control (ADVC). The voltage is now regulated at the MV busbar acting
	on the on-load tap changer of the HV/MV transformer. This method
	does not guarantee the correct voltage value in the network nodes
	when the distributed generators deliver their power. In contrast,
	the ADVC allows control of the voltage acting on a single generator;
	therefore, a better voltage profile can be obtained. In this paper,
	an approach based on sensitivity theory is shown to control the node
	voltages regulating the reactive power injected by the generators.
	After the theoretical analysis, a numerical example is presented
	to validate the theory. The proposed voltage regulation method has
	been developed in collaboration with Enel Distribuzione S.p.A. (the
	major Italian DSO), and it will be applied in the Smart Grids POI-P3
	pilot project, which is financed by the Italian Economic Development
	Ministry. Before the real field application in the pilot project,
	a real-time digital simulation has been used to validate the algorithm
	presented. Moving in this direction, Enel Distribuzione S.p.A. built
	a new test center in Milan equipped with a real-time digital simulator
	(from RTDS Technologies).},

	Advanced DMS assesses smart functions in the distribution system

	dispatch, voltage regulation, contingency analysis, capability maximization,
	or line switching. Optimal power flow (OPF)-based tools can be suitably
	adapted to the requirements of smart distribution network and be

	present a methodology for unbalanced three-phase OPF (TOPF) for DMS
	in a smart grid. In the formulation of the TOPF, control variables
	of the optimization problem are actual active load demand and reactive
	power outputs of microgenerators. The TOPF is based on a quasi-Newton

  abstract = {This paper proposes and compares three iterative approaches for handling
	discrete variables in optimal power flow (OPF) computations. The
	first two approaches rely on the sensitivities of the objective and
	inequality constraints with respect to discrete variables. They set
	the discrete variables values either by solving a mixed-integer linear
	programming (MILP) problem or by using a simple procedure based on
	a merit function. The third approach relies on the use of Lagrange
	multipliers corresponding to the discrete variables bound constraints
	at the OPF solution. The classical round-off technique and a progressive
	round-off approach have been also used as a basis of comparison.
	We provide extensive numerical results with these approaches on four
	test systems with up to 1203 buses, and for two OPF problems: loss
	minimization and generation cost minimization, respectively. These
	results show that the sensitivity-based approach combined with the
	merit function clearly outperforms the other approaches in terms
	of: objective function quality, reliability, and computational times.
	Furthermore, the objective value obtained with this approach has
	been very close to that provided by the continuous relaxation OPF.
	This approach constitutes therefore a viable alternative to other
	methods dealing with discrete variables in an OPF.},

	The decline of voltage stability level will restrict the increase

  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks utilize large numbers of wireless sensor
	nodes to collect information from their sensing terrain. Wireless
	sensor nodes are battery-powered devices. Energy saving is always
	crucial to the lifetime of a wireless sensor network. Recently, many
	algorithms are proposed to tackle the energy saving problem in wireless
	sensor networks. In these algorithms, however, data collection efficiency
	is usually compromised in return for gaining longer network lifetime.
	There are strong needs to develop wireless sensor networks algorithms
	with optimization priorities biased to aspects besides energy saving.
	In this paper, a delay-aware data collection network structure for
	wireless sensor networks is proposed. The objective of the proposed
	network structure is to minimize delays in the data collection processes
	of wireless sensor networks. Two network formation algorithms are
	designed to construct the proposed network structure in a centralized
	and a decentralized approach. Performances of the proposed network
	structure are evaluated using computer simulations. Simulation results
	show that, when comparing with other common network structures in
	wireless sensor networks, the proposed network structure is able
	to shorten the delays in the data collection process significantly.},

  abstract = {The problem of optimal control of power distribution systems is becoming
	increasingly compelling due to the progressive penetration of distributed
	energy resources in this specific layer of the electrical infrastructure.
	Distribution systems are, indeed, experiencing significant changes
	in terms of operation philosophies that are often based on optimal
	control strategies relying on the computation of linearized dependencies
	between controlled (e.g., voltages, frequency in case of islanding
	operation) and control variables (e.g., power injections, transformers
	tap positions). As the implementation of these strategies in real-time
	controllers imposes stringent time constraints, the derivation of
	analytical dependency between controlled and control variables becomes
	a non-trivial task to be solved. With reference to optimal voltage
	and power flow controls, this paper aims at providing an analytical
	derivation of node voltages and line currents as a function of the
	nodal power injections and transformers tap-changers positions. Compared
	to other approaches presented in the literature, the one proposed
	here is based on the use of the $[{bf Y}]$ compound matrix of a generic
	multi-phase radial unbalanced network. In order to estimate the computational
	benefits of the proposed approach, the relevant improvements are
	also quantified versus traditional methods. The validation of the
	proposed method is carried out by using both IEEE 13 and 34 nodes
	test feeders. The paper finally shows the use of the proposed method
	for the problem of optimal voltage control applied to the IEEE 34
	node test feeder.},

  abstract = {A simple and systematic two-winding, three-phase transformer modelling
	for steady-state unbalanced conditions is proposed. The model is
	valid for three-legged, five-legged and triplex (transformer bank)
	core designs. It is derived from the primitive (or unconnected winding)
	equations of the transformer and uses two parameters only: the short-circuit
	and the zero-sequence magnetising impedances. Both phase and sequence
	nodal equations are systematically obtained for all possible phase
	shifts and all winding connections, including the isolated wyes and
	the impedance-grounded wyes on one or both transformer sides. The
	proposed model can be considered as a generalisation of the usual
	model in the literature (which is only valid for the transformer
	bank; moreover, only specific phase shifts have been developed and
	the impedance-grounded wyes are not usually considered). Furthermore,
	the zero-sequence scheme is analysed in depth, from which the following
	conclusions are highlighted: (1) the voltage of the neutral point
	in the isolated wye cases also depends on the connection of the other
	winding; (2) the zero-sequence admittances for all connections can
	be obtained from the zero-sequence admittances of the Yz-Yz connection
	by taking limits as ztildenp or ztildens tends to infinity or to
	zero. The study is divided into two parts. Part I is devoted to core
	modelling and to four detailed examples. Part II summarises the general

	of photovoltaic (PV) power production in low-voltage (LV) grids by
	means of solar inverters with reactive power control capability.
	This paper underlines weak points of standard reactive power strategies
	which are already imposed by certain grid codes, and then, the study
	introduces a new reactive power control method that is based on sensitivity
	analysis. The sensitivity analysis shows that the same amount of
	reactive power becomes more effective for grid voltage support if
	the solar inverter is located at the end of a feeder. Based on this
	fundamental knowledge, a location-dependent power factor set value
	can be assigned to each inverter, and the grid voltage support can
	be achieved with less total reactive power consumption. In order
	to prevent unnecessary reactive power absorption from the grid during
	admissible voltage range or to increase reactive power contribution
	from the inverters that are closest to the transformer during grid
	overvoltage condition, the proposed method combines two droop functions
	that are inherited from the standard cos #x03C6;(P) and Q(U) strategies.
	Its performance comparison in terms of grid losses and voltage variation
	with different reactive power strategies is provided by modeling
	and simulating a real suburban LV network.},

	model whose quiescent state is the solution of the desired power
	flow problem. In theory, the method should converge any steady-state-stable
	power flow model, and it should never produce unstable solutions.
	Experience to date with a prototype is encouraging, and further research
	and development seem warranted. At present, the method is computationally
	rather slow. Its potential value is on problems where standard power
	flow methods fail or might converge to unstable points.},

	The implementation of SG technology, with resultant changes in power

	duties will be affected by the following: 1) the integration of renewable
	energy sources; 2) more precise operational voltage control levels
	for conservation voltage control; and 3) the flexibility, using SG
	data and communication capabilities, to rapidly change distribution
	system configurations for maximum SG benefits. If the present distribution
	systems with radial operations evolve into multiple source systems
	and feeders, more applications of transformer paralleling will likely
	also exist. The application of paralleling methods and the determination
	and confirmation of optimum operation may further contribute to excessive
	tap-change operations. As described, changing system conditions are
	affected by automatic operations on the transmission and distribution

  abstract = {In a distribution system containing a step voltage regulator (SVR),
	the maximum capacity of distributed generators (DGs) is calculated
	for DGs completely dispersed on a distribution line. The maximum
	capacity of the DGs is calculated under the constraint of an upper
	or lower voltage regulation value and an allowable current value
	by using voltage and current profiles expressed analytically in terms
	of our proposed power density model. As the voltage control method
	for the SVRs, we consider the conventional SVR, whose transformation
	ratio is fixed to 1 if it detects reverse power flow, and a reverse
	power flow SVR which operates appropriately even if it detects reverse
	power flow.Calculation of the maximum capacity of DGs with respect
	to the power factor of the DGs indicates which parameters, including
	the power factor of the DGs, the distribution of the DGs, and the
	load, influence the maximum DG capacity. Calculation of the maximum
	capacity of DGs versus the system length indicates that the constraints
	can be subdivided into two modes in the conventional SVR and four
	modes in the reverse power flow SVR. The maximum DG capacity in the
	system with a reverse power flow SVR is larger than that in a system
	with the conventional SVR. Â© 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Electr

  abstract = {Electrical distribution system suffers from various problems, such
	as reactive power burden, unbalanced loading, voltage regulation,
	and harmonic distortion. Though DSTATCOMS are ideal solutions for
	these systems, they can be costly and have complexity compared to
	other reactive power compensation solutions. Phasewise-balanced reactive
	power compensations are required for fast-changing loads needing
	dynamic power factor correcting devices leading to terminal voltage
	stabilization. Static var compensators (SVCs) are preferred for these
	loads due to low cost and simple control strategy. These SVCs, while
	correcting power factor, inherently create harmonics due to the nonsinusoidal
	currents caused by the operation of thyristor-controlled reactors.
	This paper proposes minimizing the harmonics injected into the distribution
	systems with the operation of TSC-TCR-type SVC used in conjunction
	with fast-changing loads at the LV distribution level. The fuzzy
	logic system and ANNare used to solve this nonlinear problem, giving
	optimum triggering delay angles used to trigger thyristors in TCR.

	voltages without the need of the full system data and extensive studies
	to tune the control parameters. Hence, the method is autonomous and

	to the rephasing rules, the rephasing strategy has been derived to
	identify the laterals and distribution transformers for phasing adjustment.
	After executing the proposed rephasing strategy by Taipower engineers,
	the phase currents and neutral current of test feeder has been collected

  abstract = {This paper proposes a coordinated control of distributed energy storage
	system (ESS) with traditional voltage regulators including the on-load
	tap changer transformers (OLTC) and step voltage regulators (SVR)
	to solve the voltage rise problem caused by the high photovoltaic
	(PV) penetration in the low-voltage distribution network. The main
	objective of this coordinated control is to relieve the tap changer
	transformer operation stress, shave the distribution network peak
	load and decrease the transmission and distribution resistive power
	losses under high solar power penetration. The proposed control method
	limits the energy storage depth of discharge in order to meet a more
	than ten-year cycle life. A benchmark distribution network model
	was developed in the Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) and the simulation
	results from the studied cases verified the proposed coordinated
	control strategy. The experimental implementation of proposed control
	algorithms were developed based on a power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL)
	test bed with a 22 kWh ESS, a smart meter, Labview controller, and
	RTDS. The experimental results were consistent with those obtained

	increasingly employed in modern power systems, especially in distribution

	of transmission systems and hence the investment, but also enhance
	the security and stability of the power system concerned, improve
	voltage quality, increase energy utilization and reduce pollution
	emission. However, these advantages can be fully explored if the
	sitting and sizing of DGs are properly optimized. Inappropriate sitting
	and sizing of DGs could even lead to the increase in network losses
	and the drop of voltage quality at some buses. Given this background,
	a sensitivity based approach is presented to identify the optimal
	sitting of DGs. On the other hand, the optimal sizing of DGs is determined
	by the Modified Primal-Dual Interior Point Algorithm (MPDIPA) with
	an objective of maintaining the voltage profile at the optimal level.
	IEEE 123-node test feeder is employed to verify the effectiveness
	of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the proposed

	Static Compensator (DSTATCOM) in a microgrid is proposed in this
	paper. With high penetration of distributed sources and single phase
	operation of the system, voltage unbalance can often go beyond the
	acceptable limit. With the feeders geographically spread out, it
	is not always possible to achieve reactive compensation at optimum
	location with the three phase devices. In this paper, a simple control
	strategy for DSTATCOM with communication in loop is proposed. The
	proposed reactive compensation technique is based on the voltage
	sag and the power flow in the line. The power flow and the voltage
	at different locations of the feeders are communicated to the DSTATCOM
	to modulate the reactive compensation. The single phase DSTATCOM
	compensates for the reactive power deficiency in the phase while
	the DGs supply maximum available active power. During reactive power
	limit of the DG, the maximum available active power is fixed to a
	value lower than maximum active power to increase reactive power
	injection capability of the DGs. A primary control loop based on
	local measurement in the DSTATCOM always ensures a part of reactive
	compensation in case of communication failure. It is shown that the
	proposed method can always ensure to achieve acceptable voltage regulation.
	The data traffic analysis of the communication scheme and closed

  abstract = {The paper is devoted to the development of a neural network architecture
	which implements the Newton-Raphson algorithm for solving the set
	of nonlinear equations of power-system load-flow analysis. The principal
	context is that of online network analysis in energy management systems
	with particular reference to the optimal power-flow function. The
	author shows that the complete Newton-Raphson load-flow formulation
	maps into an array of two-layer neural networks. The development
	starts from a formulation for solving as a minimisation problem the
	linearised equation system to which the Newton-Raphson sequence leads
	at each iteration. For that purpose, an objective function in quadratic
	form is derived. A neural network structure is given which implements
	the steepest descent method for minimising this objective function.
	It is shown that the weighting coefficients of neural networks are
	formed from element values in the Jacobian matrix of Newton-Raphson
	load-flow analysis. When the Jacobian matrix is nonsingular, the
	quadratic objective function derived has a unique and global minimum.
	A principal feature of the extensive parallel processing capability
	of the architecture developed is that the computing time of load-flow
	analysis is independent of the number of nodes in the power network
	for which analysis is carried out. For a sample section of a power
	network, and by software simulation, the architecture which the paper
	seeks to report gives solutions which are identical with those from

	square matrix known as element incidence matrix. The power flow equations
	are rewritten in terms of a new variable as complex linear recursive
	equations. The linear equations are solved to determine the bus voltages,
	currents in terms of new variable as complex numbers. The advantage
	of this algorithm is that it does not need any initial value for
	voltages and easier to develop the code since all the equations are
	expressed in matrix format. It is tested on the distribution systems
	available in the literature. This proposed method can be applied
	to distribution systems having voltage controlled buses also. The
	results prove the efficiency of the proposed method.},

	presented in this paper uses a newer, very successful approach-the
	Krylov subspace methodology-developed in applied linear algebra for
	the iterative solution of large, sparse systems of linear equations.
	The method has been adapted to nonlinear equations and used for the
	solution of the power flow problem with either an approximation of
	the Jacobian, as in the fast decoupled load flow, or in a direct
	Newton-like manner but without explicitly forming the Jacobian. Convergence
	rates are from linear to almost quadratic. The general methodology
	is described as well as its application to the power flow problem.
	The main advantage of KSPF is that no matrix factorizations, only
	sparse matrix-vector multiplications or evaluations of residuals,
	are used. Preliminary tests suggest that KSPF may become a competitive
	alternative to existing methods, especially in the case of large

  abstract = {The distribution network operators (DNOs) are responsible for securing
	a diverse and viable energy supply for their customers so the technical
	and economical impacts of distributed generation (DG) units are of
	great concerns. Traditionally, the DNOs try to maximize the technical
	performance of the distribution network, but it is evident that the
	first step in optimizing a quantity is being able to calculate it.
	The DG investment/operation which is performed by distributed generation
	operators/owners (DGOs) (under unbundling rules) has made this task
	more complicated. This is mainly because the DNO is faced with the

  abstract = {This paper presents a method for cooperative allocation of step voltage
	regulators (SVRs) and static var compensators (SVCs) when some distributed
	generators (DGs) are installed in a distribution system. In the proposed
	method, reactive tabu search (RTS) with multiple structures and functions
	is applied. First, the allocations of the SVRs are selected optimally
	and then the tap positions of the SVRs are optimized by the RTS.
	Finally, the locations of the SVC are chosen in order to enhance
	the voltage profile in the distribution network. The proposed method
	enables us to take account of the installation cost of both SVRs
	and SVCs as an economic criterion, of the upper and lower voltage
	limit at each node, and also of the upper limit of line currents
	as constraints. By applying the proposed method to a practical distribution
	test system (IEEE 34 Node Test Feeder Model), it is verified that
	this method is efficient in allocating SVRs and SVCs at minimum cost
	and in regulating the system voltages within an appropriate range
	after introducing DGs into the distribution system. Â© 2008 Wiley

  abstract = { In this paper, a hybrid Taguchi-genetic algorithm (HTGA) is proposed
	to solve global numerical optimization problems with continuous variables.
	The HTGA combines the traditional genetic algorithm (TGA), which
	has a powerful global exploration capability, with the Taguchi method,
	which can exploit the optimum offspring. The Taguchi method is inserted
	between crossover and mutation operations of a TGA. Then, the systematic
	reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is incorporated in the crossover
	operations to select the better genes to achieve crossover, and consequently,
	enhance the genetic algorithm. Therefore, the HTGA can be more robust,
	statistically sound, and quickly convergent. The proposed HTGA is
	effectively applied to solve 15 benchmark problems of global optimization
	with 30 or 100 dimensions and very large numbers of local minima.
	The computational experiments show that the proposed HTGA not only
	can find optimal or close-to-optimal solutions but also can obtain
	both better and more robust results than the existing algorithm reported
	recently in the literature.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the connected photovoltaic (PV) power generation
	system's grid overvoltage protection function and summarizes the
	occurrence of the output power loss due to the grid voltage rise.
	Power injection from the PV system will raise the voltage at the
	power distribution line. A power conditioning subsystem (PCS) needs
	to regulate its output if the voltage becomes higher than the upper
	limit in order to avoid the overvoltage at the power grid. Thus,
	a PV system cannot generate electricity under the high grid voltage.
	There are 553 residential PV systems installed in Ota, Japan, for
	the demonstration research project of clustered PV systems. Measurement
	data of these 2.1-MW grid-connected PV systems are used for the analysis.
	Only the limited number of PV systems experienced a significant amount
	of output energy loss due to the high grid voltage in a particular
	day, whereas the other system's outputs also raise the grid voltage.
	The causes of this maldistribution of the output energy loss are
	the difference of the line impedance, the difference of the starting
	voltage of the PCS's grid overvoltage protection function, and the
	imbalance of the load in single-phase three-wire power distribution
	systems. The present control of the PCS successfully avoids the overvoltage
	on the grid but cannot share the loss.},

  abstract = {Load demand in small autonomous island systems is typically covered
	by Diesel Units (DU). Although a favourable renewable energy source
	(RES) potential might exist, the technical constraints introduced
	by the conventional generators result in relatively low RES penetration
	levels, typically up to 15%-20% of the annual energy demand. To overcome
	such limitations, introduction of energy storage is necessary. In
	the case of very small islands (less than 1 MW peak load), lead-acid
	battery energy storage systems (BESS) constitute a technically mature
	solution with considerable application potential. In this paper,
	the potential for achieving very high RES penetration levels with
	the introduction of BESS in an existing small island system is investigated.
	An operating policy is first introduced for the overall system, including
	conventional generators, RES (wind and photovoltaic) stations and
	storage system. Simulation results are then presented to quantify
	the expected energy benefits in terms of RES energy penetration and
	the impact on the economics of the island system. The sizing of the
	hybrid system components is then investigated by conducting a parametric

  abstract = {In a geographically small distribution area, fast moving clouds may
	cover the whole area within a short period causing photovoltaic (PV)
	power to drop. When a feeder loses PV power support, bus voltages
	will decrease. In an unbalanced network, asymmetrical spacing and
	non-transposition of line configurations can result in different
	voltage drops for each phase. This may potentially cause some voltage
	problems after a decline in PV generation, such as an extremely low
	voltage magnitude of a certain phase and an unacceptable voltage
	imbalance level at a remote bus. This paper proposes a method of
	analyzing voltage variation sensitivity due to PV power fluctuations
	in an unbalanced network (unbalanced line configuration and phase
	loading levels). Based on this method, a network reconfiguration
	solution is developed to solve the voltage problems. This solution
	utilizes unbalanced line characteristics and realizes the potential
	of the network, so no extra compensation devices are needed for network
	support.},

	close enough to the voltage at the substation. The reactive power
	is controlled through the inverter on the PV cells. The control signals

	a current mismatch formulation in rectangular coordinates is proposed.
	In contrast to the classical way of solving the Newton equation that
	is involved, using a power mismatch formulation, the basic advantage
	of the proposed method is that, in the current mismatch formulation,
	some second derivatives become zero and some first derivatives become
	constant. In current mismatch formulation the elements Hij of the
	Hessian matrix are zero and the Jacobian elements Jii, Jij, Jji and
	Jjj are constant whereas in the power mismatch formulation for both
	cases those elements are functions of the voltage. These features
	make the computer code simpler. A theoretical comparison between
	the current mismatch formulation and the power mismatch formulation
	in rectangular coordinates is presented to point out their differences.
	Numerical examples on the IEEE 14-bus, IEEE 30-bus, IEEE 57-bus,
	IEEE 118-bus and IEEE 300-bus systems are presented to illustrate
